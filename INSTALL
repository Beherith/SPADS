To install SPADS on Linux/UNIX, you have to:
============================================

1) Ensure Perl, swig, g++, and wget are installed and available in your PATH
2) Install Spring dedicated, and remember "spring-dedicated" and "Spring data directory" locations (they will be asked during SPADS installation)
3) Install at least one mod in Spring data directory
4) Run "./spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
5) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf" (default map is DeltaSiegeDry, you may want to change this ;) ), "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"./spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "./spads.pl etc/spads.conf")



To install SPADS on Windows, you have to:
=========================================

1) Install ActivePerl Windows (x86) (available here: http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads), and ensure your Perl bin directory is in your PATH environement variable
2) Install wget (available here: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe), and ensure your wget bin directory is in your PATH environment variable
3) Install Spring if not installed yet, and remember install location (it will be asked during SPADS installation as "Spring data directory")
4) Install at least one Spring mod
5) Open a Command shell, go in the directory where you extracted SPADS installation files, and run "perl spadsInstaller.pl" (SPADS will be installed in current directory)
6) Check your configuration files, in particular "spads.conf" (default map is DeltaSiegeDry, you may want to change this ;) ), "hostingPresets.conf" and "battlePresets.conf"

Then you can run SPADS as follows:
"perl spads.pl <spadsConfPath>" (for instance: "perl spads.pl etc/spads.conf")



If you have any problem, you can contact me (bibim) directly in Spring lobby or forums
