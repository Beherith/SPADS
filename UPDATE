                  Help file for SPADS manual updates
==============================================================================
Some SPADS updates require manual modifications in configuration files. When
this happens, SPADS does NOT auto-update because it wouldn't be able to
restart without these modifications. Instead, it logs an alert and continues
running normally.

This file explains for each SPADS manual update how to add the required new
settings with their default values. You just have to follow the section
concerning your update. If you need additional information about these new
settings, you can check the SPADS settings documentation here:
  http://planetspads.free.fr/spads/doc/spadsDoc.html

You can also check that your modifications are correct by taking a look at the
up-to-date configuration templates available here (replace <release> by your
actual SPADS release: "stable", "testing" or "unstable"):
  http://planetspads.free.fr/spads/conf/templates/<release>/

Then, when the manual actions have been performed, you can force an update of
all SPADS packages by entering the following command from SPADS installation
directory (replace <release> by your actual SPADS release: "stable", "testing"
or "unstable"):
  on Linux: ./update.pl <release> -f -a
  on Windows: perl update.pl <release> -f -A

Finally you can take a look at what changed during this update by checking the
changelog available here:
