                  Help file for SPADS manual updates
==============================================================================
Some SPADS updates require manual modifications in configuration files. When
this happens, SPADS does NOT auto-update because it wouldn't be able to
restart without these modifications. Instead, it logs an alert and continues
running normally.

This file explains for each SPADS manual update how to add the required new
settings with their default values. You just have to follow the section
concerning your update. If you need additional information about these new
settings, you can check the SPADS settings documentation here:
  http://planetspads.free.fr/spads/doc/spadsDoc.html

You can also check that your modifications are correct by taking a look at the
up-to-date configuration templates available here (replace <release> by your
actual SPADS release: "stable", "testing" or "unstable"):
  http://planetspads.free.fr/spads/conf/templates/<release>/

Then, when the manual actions have been performed, you can force an update of
all SPADS packages by entering the following command from SPADS installation
directory (replace <release> by your actual SPADS release: "stable", "testing"
or "unstable"):
  on Linux: ./update.pl <release> -f -a
  on Windows: perl update.pl <release> -f -a

Finally you can take a look at what changed during this update by checking the
changelog available here:

  1) Actions in spads.conf
  ------------------------
- remove following global setting definitions:
  binDir, autoUpdateBinaries, onBadSpringVersion
- remove following preset setting definitions:
  minRankForPasswd, minLevelForPasswd
- add following global setting definitions:
  instanceDir:
  autoManagedSpringVersion:
  autoManagedSpringDir:spring
  unitsyncDir:<absolute_path_of_the_directory_containing_the_unitsync_library>
  simpleEventLogLevel:4
  eventModel:auto
  maxChildProcesses:16
- rename the "minLevelForIpAddr" global setting to "privacyTrustLevel"
- check the value of the "springieEmulation" global setting:
  if it is set to "on" (old default value), change it to "warn"
- check the value of the "kickBanDuration" global setting:
  if it is set to "120" (old default value), change it to 300
- check the value of the "pluginsDir" global setting:
  if it is empty (old default value), set it to "plugins" and create the subdirectory "plugins" in the directory pointed by the "varDir" global setting
  if it is not empty, ensure the corresponding directory exists
- check the allowed values for the "balanceMode" preset setting:
  if one of the values is "clan" (second value in default configuration), change it to "clan;random"

  2) Other actions
  ----------------
- create the subdirectory "spring" in the directory pointed by the "varDir" global setting
- remove the "!pass" command declaration in commands.conf:
  remove the line "[pass]" and the non-empty line(s) just after, such as "::|0:"
- following plugins must be updated to latest version if you plan to use them: FirstWelcomeMsg, InGameMute, ReverseLookup

  3) Optional actions
  -------------------
- if you are hosting several SPADS instances running from same SPADS installation, then you need to adjust your "varDir" and "instanceDir" global settings in spads.conf:
  the "varDir" global setting no longer needs to be different for each SPADS instance (and it can be an absolute path or a path relative to SPADS installation directory), so you can set it back to default value: "var"
  the "instanceDir" global setting is the directory which must be different for each SPADS instance, so you can set it to your old "varDir" value
- if you want to use the new "Spring version auto-management" functionality of SPADS (recommended), in spads.conf:
  set the "autoManagedSpringVersion" global setting to the desired Spring version (example: "103.0")
  set the "springServer" and "unitsyncDir" global settings to empty values
  set the "springServerType" global setting to "dedicated" (or "headless" if you want to use headless server)
  remove any Spring data directory containing Spring base files (content specific to a given Spring version) from "springDataDir" global setting value

  4) Post-update action
  ---------------------
- finally, after the "./update.pl <release> -f -a" command has been executed, the Perl unitsync library interface module must be re-generated (on Linux system only):
  "./spadsInstaller.pl -g"
