This plugin implements dynamic rotation map lists: the rotation map list is
changed automatically depending on current battle context (number of players,
number of teams, start position type...).
The rules used to indicate which rotation map lists must be applied are defined
in the configuration file named DynamicMapRotation.conf. The first rule
matching current battle context is used to choose which map list to apply as
current rotation list.
A rather concrete example of configuration using a lot of different map lists
is provided with this plugin. You can use it as a base to build your own rules,
but you will need to define the corresponding map lists in your mapLists.conf
file.
As for all table-type SPADS configuration files, the first line is the full
template declaration, which indicates all fields which can be used in your
rules (these fields are explained in detail in the file header).
Lines starting with "#?" are template definitions: they define which fields
(and in which order) are used in the following rules declarations.
When a rule contains an undefined field, it means it matches any value for this
field.
