This plugin automatically removes temporary bans (bans set using command
!kickBan) at the end of each game. The temporary ban duration (kickBanDuration
setting in spads.conf) is still respected, it just becomes the maximum
temporary ban duration (if no game is played meanwhile). So you have to
increase your kickBanDuration value for this plugin to have any effect.
