TLS downloads (HTTPS) are only supported if the IO::Socket::SSL perl module is 
installed. On Windows this module should already be installed by default. On 
main Linux distributions, the installation of this module can be performed 
through the standard package manager. For example:
. Debian/Ubuntu: "apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl"
. RedHat/Centos: "yum install perl-IO-Socket-SSL"
It is also possible to install this module using CPAN binary:
  "cpan IO::Socket::SSL"
