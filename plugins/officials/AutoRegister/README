By default this plugin is configured in plugin-dependency mode: the
autoregistration functionality is provided for other plugins which can enable it
if needed, but it is disabled by default.
If you want to use this plugin in standalone mode and enable autoregistration
by default, you need to set the "enabled" setting to 1 in the configuration
file.
