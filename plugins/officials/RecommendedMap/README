By default this plugin makes SPADS use Springie recommended maps service for
map rotation, and use Springie map boxes service only if no start box has been
saved for this map yet. You can change this behaviour by editing the
RecommendedMap.conf file.

This plugin depends on the SpringieExtension plugin, which must be loaded in
SPADS beforehand.
