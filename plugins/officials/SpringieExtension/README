The SpringieExtension plugin implements the lobby protocol extension used by
Springie autohost and Zero-K lobby. The main purpose of this plugin is to make
all Springie/Zero-K data and services easily accessible from other SPADS
plugins, and to increase SPADS compatibility with Springie by emulating the
!transmit, !cheats, !hostsay, !corners, !setoptions, !votesetoptions and
!voteresign commands (!voteresign requires the Resign plugin). This plugin also
allows SPADS admins to give specific rights to users depending on their
Springie/Zero-K access levels, through the SpringieExtension.users.conf
configuration file (same syntax as main SPADS users.conf file).

This plugin depends on the SOAP::Lite Perl module which must be installed
using the corresponding package manager on your system, for example:
  on Windows:
      ppm install SOAP-Lite
  on Debian/Ubuntu:
      apt-get install libsoap-lite-perl
