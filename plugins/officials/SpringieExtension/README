The SpringieExtension plugin implements the lobby protocol extension used by
Springie autohost and Zero-K lobby. This plugin by itself doesn't do much, it
just allows SPADS admins to give specific rights to users depending on their
Springie/Zero-K access levels, through the SpringieExtension.users.conf
configuration file (same syntax as main SPADS users.conf file). But this plugin
also makes all Springie/Zero-K data easily accessible for other SPADS plugins,
which is its main purpose.

This plugin depends on the SOAP::Lite Perl module which must be installed
using the corresponding package manager on your system, for example:
  on Windows:
      ppm install SOAP-Lite
  on Debian/Ubuntu:
      apt-get install libsoap-lite-perl
