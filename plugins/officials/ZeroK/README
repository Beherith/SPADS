This plugin makes SPADS compatible with the Springie/Zero-K infrastructure,
providing most of the corresponding functionalities (clan management, Elo
ranking, recommended maps for rotation, custom commanders, awards...). All the
functionalities are enabled in the configuration file except the Elo-based
balancing (SPADS has its own TrueSkill ranking system for that), and battle
result submission to Zero-K site (this requires sending unencrypted password,
see config file).

This plugin depends on the SpringieExtension plugin, which must be loaded in
SPADS beforehand.

Due to the way the Zero-K lobby works, when hosting Zero-K games it is
recommended to change SPADS default configuration regarding !start command as
follows in commands.conf (the first "10" becomes "100" in the first
configuration line of the "start" section):

    [start]
    battle,pv:player:stopped|100:10
    ::stopped|100:

This will force Zero-K players to call a vote to start a game, as they are used
to.
