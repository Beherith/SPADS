The "first welcome message" must be set in a file named "FirstWelcomeMsg.txt"
in your SPADS etc directory. The plugin monitors this file in real time, you
don't need to reload anything when you update it.

The "first welcome message" won't be re-sent even if you modify it. If you want
to re-send it on first join because you added important information to it, you
can use the !resendFirstWelcomeMsg command.
