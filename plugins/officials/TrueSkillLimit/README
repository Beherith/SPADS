This plugin automatically specs players whose TrueSkill rating doesn't match
the minimum (minTrueSkill) and maximum (maxTrueSkill) values, and the maximum
uncertainty (maxUncertainty) configured in TrueSkillLimit.conf.
By default the plugin applies TrueSkill limits on the Team TrueSkill rating.
You can change this by editing the trueSkillType setting (allowed types are:
"Duel", "Team", "FFA" and "TeamFFA").
